Sign in to view Copy link Quote reply dpunosevac commented Sep 28, 2017 I would like to contribute it. I see that you have no shell sort algorithm for Java. I would take that one first. Than later I would continue with few mores, if that is ok. This comment has been minimized.

Sign in to view Copy link Quote reply Contributor mpokryva commented Sep 28, 2017 • edited Ok, I will take that then. Or, if you want, @dpunosevac , you can do that, and I can do some bit algorithms, as I don't see any of those. This comment has been minimized. Sign in to view Copy link Quote reply dpunosevac commented Sep 28, 2017 @mpokryva I mistakenly thought you were talking to me. And not asking for yourself. Anyway, you can grab that one, and I hope that @dynamitechetan needs shellsort, so I do that one. This comment has been minimized.

Sign in to view Copy link Quote reply Contributor rei2hu commented Sep 29, 2017 Please look over pull requests before merging because I noticed the most recent one won't even compile properly and I'm assuming that a lot of people will make PRs soon because of Hacktoberfest (myself included). For example, in PR #101 there are many errors. Can't compile because there is no type for len_a and len_b Can't compile because calculate_distance is a non-static method One of the loops will go on forever because it's declared as for(int j = 0; i < len_b; j++) and i is not getting updated within the loop. 👍 3 This comment has been minimized.

The long term goal should be to make this repo as a one stop solution for Java algorithms rather than a repository with bunch of random interview problems. 👍 3 varunu28 referenced this issue Sep 29, 2017 Merged Added SieveOfEratosthenes.java #102 This comment has been minimized.

I've seen that you have a subdirectory for crypto algorithms, but you're still missing an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. I'd love to build that for you unless you see a problem with that. NISHITA97 referenced this issue Nov 19, 2017 Merged Added SaddlebackSearch #318 This comment has been minimized.
